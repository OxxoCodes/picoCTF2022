The provided file is a .svg file. This type of file indicates that the contents are a *Vector image*.


To keep things simple, Vector images differs from traditional images in that, instead of using pixels, they use mathematical equations to represent the shapes that make up the image. This gives them extreme scalability, as mathematical equations don't look worse when viewed closely like pixels do.



Lucky for us, vector art also allows text to be stored as plaintext within the file!



As such, one option would be to edit the file contents to make the text larger and/or a different color to become more visible.

However, the easy solution is to just open the provided file in a text editor of your choice and to look for the flag yourself!



the p,i,c,o,C, and T can be found on lines 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, and 110, respectively.



The remaining portion of the flag can be found on lines 115 and 120.
