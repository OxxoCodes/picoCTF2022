Open the link from the README (or the .html file if the link is unavailable) in your favorite web browser.  Then, open its developer tools page. This can typically be done by pressing CTRL+Shift+I



You should notice that there are two files included in this website: `style.css` and `scripts.css`. These are files that are part of the website itself, but aren't included in the base `.html` file, which is what you typically see when you "Inspect Element."



Go to `websiteUrl/scripts.css` and `websiteURL/style.css` and open your developer tools once again and you should clearly see the first and second parts of the flag listed.
