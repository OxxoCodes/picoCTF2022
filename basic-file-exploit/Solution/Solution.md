The flag is stored in the `flag` variable. The value is "[REDACTED]" in our case.
This flag is only ever accessed once - on line 144. As such, this is our target line of execution.

This line is only executed if the preceding `if` statement returns true.
This only occurs when `strtol` returns zero, and that value is assigned to `entry_number`.

So, how can we force `strtol` to fail? Let's look at what inputs are available to us.

This `if` statement is within the `data_read` function, which only occurs when the user attempts to read a previously user-entered string.
At this point in the function, ignoring the `data_write` function, our only input is the entry number.
Thankfully, the entry number is what is used in `strtol`! The function attempts to convert the entry number string to a `long`.

In C, a string is just a char array, and it has two components: the string contents, and the terminator char: '\0'
We can cause strtol to fail by simply making our string too long to fit within the 4-byte char array.
This causes the '\0' to not be stored within the bounds of the array, and that will subsequently cause `strotol` to fail.
This will cause the `if` statement to trigger, and the flag to be revealed.
