To solve this challenge, all you have to do is run this program in the Linux terminal.



If you don't already have a Linux environment set up, you need to do so. If you are on Windows, I would recommend looking into WSL, as it can be extremely convenient. If you are on a different platform, or don't wish to use WSL, you can set up a virtual machine using software such as Virtualbox. For your Linux distro, I would recommend either Ubuntu or Linux Mint, as they are both very beginner-friendly.



Once you have entered your Linux environment, open the Terminal.



Navigate to the directory where `run` is located using `cd`.



Execute the program using `./run`, and the flag will be displayed.
