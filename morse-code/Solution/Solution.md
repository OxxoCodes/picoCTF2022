Although manually writing down the translation or writing a program to do it for me sounds like a great time, it's past 1:00 AM as I'm writing this and I will save that challenge for future me. For now, let's use someone else's code!



Simply go to this site:

[Morse Code Adaptive Audio Decoder | Morse Code World](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html)



Upload your audio file, click play, and get the decrypted message!



Once you have your message, convert each character to lowercase and put underscores instead of spaces. Wrap that inside of `picoCTF{}` and you're good to go!
